Linear Control:
====================================
Contains the design and simulation files for a integrated LQR control scheme for the 
rotary inverted pendulum system

NMPC:
====================================
Contains the design and simulation files for a NMPC control scheme for the 
rotary inverted pendulum system. The controller uses the ACADO toolkit with a
MATLAB interface.
