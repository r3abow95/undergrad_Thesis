This research task was fulfilled as part of the requirements for the final year undergraduate project
at the university of Cape Town. The project software resources are divided according to the following:

i)	Arduino
===============================
Arduino files used to control the inverted pendulum system. This includes a linear controller implementation
and a data acquisition program

ii) 	NMPC export
===============================
C implementation of the NMPC control routine. The exported files were generated using the ACADO toolkit

iii)	Simulink_Matlab:
===============================
System models and controller designs using Matlab and Simulink. Created using MATLAB R2017a. It is recommended that
the latest version of matlab is used to ensure all function work correctly
